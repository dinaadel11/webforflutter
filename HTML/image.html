            <p>he Image Widget in Flutter

                In Flutter, the Image widget is used to display images within your app. It can be used to display images from various sources, including:
                
                Asset Images: Images stored in your app's asset bundle.   
                Network Images: Images fetched from a remote URL.   
                File Images: Images from the device's file system.
                Key Properties:

                image: The image provider, which can be an AssetImage, NetworkImage, or FileImage.
                width and height: The desired width and height of the image.
                fit: How the image should be resized to fit the given dimensions. Options include:
                BoxFit.cover: The image will fill the entire space, possibly cropping the edges.
                BoxFit.contain: The image will be scaled to fit within the space, preserving aspect ratio.
                BoxFit.fill: The image will fill the entire space, ignoring aspect ratio.
                BoxFit.none: The image will be displayed at its original size.
                  
                alignment: How the image should be aligned within the given space.
                color: A color to blend with the image.   
                colorBlendMode: The blending mode to use with the color.
