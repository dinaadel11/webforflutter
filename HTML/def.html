            <p>
                In Flutter, a widget is a basic building block of the user interface (UI).
                 Everything you see on the screen in a Flutter app is a widget,
                  including layout, text, images, buttons, and more. Widgets can be stateful or stateless:
                  <ol><li>Stateless Widget: This type of widget does not maintain any state. Once created, it remains the same until its parent rebuilds it. It is immutable, meaning its properties can't change.
                </li>
            <li>Stateful Widget: This widget can maintain a state that may change during the widget's lifetime. When the state changes, the widget is rebuilt with the new data.
            </li></ol>
           Widgets are also organized in a tree structure, with a root widget at the top, 
           from which all other widgets branch out. This allows for complex UIs to be built by composing
           simpler widgets together.
           Understanding widgets is essential for developing in Flutter, as they dictate how
           the UI appears and behaves. If you need more detailed information or examples, feel free to ask!

                Every action has a widget applied to it,
