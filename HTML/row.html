            <h3>Row</h3>
            <p>The Row Widget in Flutter

                In Flutter, the Row widget is a fundamental layout widget that arranges its children horizontally. It's a versatile tool for creating horizontal layouts, allowing you to align and space multiple widgets side-by-side.   
                
                Key Properties of a Row:
                <ul>
                <li>children: A list of widgets to be displayed horizontally.   </li>
                mainAxisAlignment: Controls how the children are aligned along the main axis (horizontally). Common values include:
               <li> MainAxisAlignment.start: Aligns children to the start.</li>
                <li>MainAxisAlignment.end: Aligns children to the end.</li>
                <li>MainAxisAlignment.center: Centers the children.</li>
                <li>MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround: Spaces children evenly, with half-size spaces at the start and end.</li>
                <li>MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween: Spaces children evenly, with no space at the start and end.</li>
                <li>MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly: Spaces children evenly, with equal spaces between and around the children.</li>
                  
                crossAxisAlignment: Controls how the children are aligned along the cross axis (vertically). Common values include:
                <li>CrossAxisAlignment.start: Aligns children to the start.</li>
                <li>CrossAxisAlignment.end: Aligns children to the end.</li>
                <li>CrossAxisAlignment.center: Centers the children.</li>
                <li>CrossAxisAlignment.stretch: Stretches the children to fill the available space.</li>
                  
                <li>mainAxisSize: Controls how the Row widget sizes itself. Common values include:</li>
                <li>MainAxisSize.max: The Row will expand to fill the available space.</li>
                <li>MainAxisSize.min: The Row will be as small as possible to fit its children.</li>
            </ul>
